# Hello, World! 🌍  

I’m @frknbkdmr, a psychiatrist-in-training who straddles the line between neurons and neural networks. Picture Freud, Karl Friston, and an AI algorithm having a coffee-fueled debate—I'm the one taking notes and trying to stay caffeinated enough to understand all sides.  

When I’m not pondering life’s biggest questions like, “What if the subconscious could be quantified with machine learning?” or “Did Nietzsche secretly invent deep learning with all that eternal recurrence talk?” I’m either working on research, decoding EEG signals, or just desperately trying to keep my cat, Zurna, off my keyboard.

## 👨‍⚕️ About Me  

- **👀 Research Focus**:  
  My work and interests orbit the fascinating triad of **psychiatry, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence**. Some highlights include:  
  - Unraveling the mysteries of mental disorders using machine learning (because Freud would’ve loved Python, I’m sure).  
  - Investigating impulsivity and addiction while occasionally losing a battle to my own impulse to check Steam sales.  
  - Studying how anxiety affects sleep patterns (while battling my own sleep-deprived state—hello, irony).  

- **🌱 What I’m Learning**:  
  Here’s what’s keeping me busy these days (aside from existential dread and paperwork):  
  - **Computational Psychiatry**: Exploring how AI can revolutionize diagnostics—because “You’re just stressed” isn’t a good enough diagnosis in the 21st century.  
  - **German Language**: Prepping for a two-month internship in Germany. *Ja, ich liebe Kaffee!*  
  - **Linear Algebra**: Eigenvectors? More like "eigen-saviors" for neural networks.  
  - **Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm**: The coolest algorithm you’ve probably never bragged about at parties.  
  - **C Programming**: Because Python sometimes feels like cheating.  

- **💞️ Collaboration Wishlist**:  
  I’d love to work with anyone who’s into:  
  - AI-driven approaches to mental health (bonus points if your favorite neuron is the dopaminergic kind).  
  - Machine learning applications in healthcare (because code and care go hand in hand).  
  - Creative projects blending tech and mental health awareness (got a podcast idea? Let’s talk).  

- **📫 Contact Me**:  
  Slide into my DMs or send me an email. Just please don’t try carrier pigeons; Zurna thinks they’re chew toys.

## 🧠 Academic Goals  

1. **Take Over the Computational Psychiatry World**: Okay, maybe not the world, but I do plan to make AI and neuroscience besties.  
2. **Research Like There’s No Tomorrow**:  
   - Gambling addiction? I’m analyzing impulsivity so you don’t have to.  
   - Anxiety messing with your sleep? I’m on it, with scales, stats, and maybe some strong coffee.  
   - Aging and daily activities? Let’s figure out how to keep doing what we love, even if the knees disagree.  
3. **Global Academia Domination**: (In a friendly, collaborative way, of course.)

## 🤖 Projects & Experiments  

- **AI Mental Health Tools**: Because someday, your therapist might be a bot, and I want to make sure it’s a good one.  
- **Reinforcement Learning for Fun & Profit**: Training agents to make better decisions—unlike me with midnight snacks.  
- **Semi-Structured Interviews**: Inspired by *The Checklist Manifesto* to make psychiatric evaluations smarter, faster, and more efficient.  
- **Dark Academia-Inspired AI Systems**: Okay, this one’s not real… yet.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Fun Facts & Quirks  

- **Fitness Journey**: Currently in a cutting phase, fueled by **high-volume exercise** and a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. Energy levels? Let’s just say I owe my mornings to coffee and willpower.  
- **CRPG Fanatic**: Whether it’s **Baldur’s Gate 3** or **Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous**, I love morally ambiguous characters—psychiatry’s influence, maybe?  
- **Dark Academia Enthusiast**: My home decor, wardrobe, and general vibe scream, “I’d totally write a philosophical thesis by candlelight.”  
- **Bald & Bold**: Shaving my head saves me at least 20 minutes a week—time I now spend explaining Bayesian brain models.

## 🤓 What Drives Me?  

The human mind is like a neural network—complex, adaptive, and occasionally prone to catastrophic forgetting. My mission is to bridge the gap between **neuroscience and technology**, turning the challenges of mental health into opportunities for innovation.  

Freud said, “Unexpressed emotions will never die.” I believe they just need better quantification tools, like fMRI machines and neural nets.

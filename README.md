# Hello, World! 🌍  

I’m @frknbkdmr, a psychiatry resident navigating the fine line between neurons and neural networks. When I’m not diagnosing mental disorders or decoding the human mind, I’m delving into the fascinating world of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

## 👨‍⚕️ About Me  

- **👀 Research Focus**:  
  My academic interests orbit around **psychiatry, artificial intelligence**, and the interplay of **brain and behavior**. Whether it's decoding EEG signals, studying the biological underpinnings of mental disorders, or hypothesizing how Freud might’ve responded to fMRI studies, I’m always on a quest for answers (and more data).  

- **🌱 What I’m Learning**:  
  I’m currently leveling up in:  
  - **Computational Psychiatry**: Exploring how AI can redefine diagnostics and interventions.  
  - **German Language**: Preparing for a two-month internship in Germany (*Danke schön, Duolingo!*).  
  - **Linear Algebra**: Because what’s a good neural network without some eigenvectors?  
  - **C Programming**: For when Python feels a little too cozy.  

- **💞️ Collaboration Wishlist**:  
  Let’s team up if you’re working on:  
  - AI applications in psychiatry  
  - Machine learning in healthcare  
  - Mental health awareness campaigns with a tech twist

## 🧠 Academic Goals  

1. **Pioneering in Computational Psychiatry**: My ultimate aim is to blend AI with neuroscience, making mental health diagnostics faster, more accurate, and personalized.  
2. **Research Contributions**:  
   - Studying **gambling addiction** and **impulsivity**.  
   - Unpacking how **anxiety disorders** alter sleep patterns.  
3. **Global Academia**: Building connections in psychiatry and machine learning communities to foster groundbreaking collaborations.

## 🤖 Projects & Experiments  

- **AI-Driven Mental Health Tools**: Working on Python scripts that could (one day) out-diagnose Dr. House.  
- **Reinforcement Learning Simulations**: Because who doesn’t want to train agents to play games (or solve real-world problems)?  
- **Semi-Structured Interview Frameworks**: Inspired by *The Checklist Manifesto*, I’m crafting tools to streamline psychiatric evaluations.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Fun Facts & Quirks  

- **Fitness Journey**: Currently on a **cutting phase**, balancing high-volume exercise and intermittent fasting (16:8). Energy levels upon waking? Let’s just say coffee remains a cornerstone of my survival. ☕  
- **CRPG Enthusiast**: I’ve spent hours on games like **Baldur’s Gate 3**, where moral ambiguity thrives (as it does in psychiatry).  
- **Dark Academia Aesthetic**: From home decor to wardrobe, I enjoy channeling my inner 19th-century scholar (minus the plague).  
- **Trivia**: I’m bald by choice—less time on hair care, more time on MATLAB simulations.

## 🤓 What Drives Me?  

The mind is like the cosmos: vast, intricate, and full of mysteries. My work aims to bridge the gap between **neurobiology and technology**, turning psychiatric challenges into opportunities for innovation. Freud once said, “Unexpressed emotions will never die.” Today, I’d argue that they’re just waiting to be quantified in an fMRI machine.

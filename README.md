### **Psychiatry Resident | Computational Researcher | Developer**

I am a psychiatry resident at **Ondokuz Mayıs University** who believes the human mind is the most complex "closed-source" system ever written. My journey began in **cybersecurity and malware analysis** (hello vxheaven), but I eventually moved from cracking code to cracking the human psyche: the ultimate biological operating system.

## 🔬 Research & Clinical Triad

I operate at the intersection of **Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and AI**, focusing on turning clinical observations into rigorous mathematical models.

* **Computational Psychiatry:** Utilizing the **Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF)** to model belief updating and sensory attenuation in schizophrenia.
* **Neuro-Engineering:** Building custom hardware for research, including a **Force-Matching Task (FMT)** device powered by Maxon motors, force sensors, and some other cool stuff.
* **Predictive Brain:** Investigating how uncertainty and volatility overestimation drive Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
* **GÖRÜNGÜ (OMR Engine):** Developing Python/OpenCV tools to automate the digitization of psychiatric scales, because manual data entry belongs in the 20th century.

## 🏋️‍♂️ The "Human" Hardware

When the white coat comes off and the terminal is closed, I focus on my own "neural updates":

* **Strength Athletics:** Data-driven fitness enthusiast. Currently tracking a **120kg bench press** and a **115.2kg barbell row**. Discipline in the gym translates to discipline in the lab.
* **CRPGs & Ethics:** Whether it’s *Baldur’s Gate 3* or *Pathfinder*, I love exploring morally ambiguous characters; perhaps a side effect of my psychiatric training.
* **Optimization:** Shaved my head for maximum aerodynamics and zero maintenance. Time saved: 20 mins/week. Value added: Infinite.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I am open to collaborations on **AI-driven mental health**, **Precision Psychiatry**, or simply discussing why your cat (like mine, **Zurna**) thinks your keyboard is a bed.

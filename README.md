# Hello, World! 🌍  

I’m **@frknbkdmr**, a psychiatrist-in-training who straddles the line between neurons and neural networks. Picture Freud, Karl Friston, and an AI algorithm having a coffee-fueled debate. I'm the one taking notes, trying to stay caffeinated enough to understand all sides, and occasionally checking my **120kg bench press** stats to make sure my own physical hardware is holding up.

When I’m not pondering life’s biggest questions like, “What if the subconscious could be quantified with machine learning?” or “Did Nietzsche secretly invent deep learning with all that eternal recurrence talk?” I’m either working on my thesis at **Ondokuz Mayıs University**, decoding Beads Task data, or desperately trying to keep my cat, **Zurna**, off my keyboard.

## 👨‍⚕️ About Me  

- **👀 Research Focus**:  
  My work orbits the triad of **psychiatry, neuroscience, and AI**. I’m particularly obsessed with:  
  - **Schizophrenia & Belief Updating**: Using the **Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF)** to model how the brain processes (mis)information.
  - **The FMT Project**: I don’t just write code; I’m building a custom **Force-Matching Task** device with Maxon motors because understanding sensory attenuation requires some "hands-on" engineering.
  - **Somatic Science**: Exploring how **Polyvagal Theory** and **TRE** can be modeled computationally—because the body keeps the score, but I want to see the spreadsheet.

- **🌱 What I’m Learning**:  
  - **German Language**: Prepping for a residency stint in **Brilon Wald (May 2026)**. *Ja, ich liebe Kaffee und Gehirnforschung!*
  - **Bayesian Inference**: Because life is just one big prior being updated by noisy evidence.
  - **Reverse Engineering (Legacy Skill)**: My roots are in **malware analysis and IDA Pro**. I’ve moved from cracking binaries to cracking the human psyche which is the ultimate closed-source system.

- **💞️ Collaboration Wishlist**:  
  - Anyone into AI-driven mental health (bonus points if your favorite neurotransmitter is Dopamine).  
  - Devs who love **OpenCV**—I'm currently perfecting **GÖRÜNGÜ**, my OMR engine for clinical scales.

## 🧠 Academic Goals  

1. **Thesis Supremacy**: Finalizing my research on delusions and sensory attenuation before December 2026.
2. **Computational Psychiatry Evangelism**: Making AI and neuroscience besties so we can stop saying "You're just stressed" and start showing the data.
3. **Global Academia Domination**: (In a friendly, collaborative way, likely involving lots of **Doom Metal** in the background).

## 🤖 Projects & Experiments  

- **GÖRÜNGÜ (OMR Application)**: A Python/OpenCV tool to digitize psychiatric scales because manual data entry is a relic of the Freud era.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training agents to make better decisions—unlike me when I see a **LEGO Botanical** set I don't own yet.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Fun Facts & Quirks  

- **Iron & Intermittent Fasting**: Currently 16:8 fasting. I’ve found that my **115kg barbell row** feels better when my insulin is low and my caffeine is high.  
- **CRPG Fanatic**: **Baldur’s Gate 3** and **Pathfinder: WotR**. I always play morally ambiguous characters—psychiatry’s influence, or just a love for complex decision trees?  
- **Home Life**: Living in **Samsun** with my wife whos a Neurology resident and yes, we argue about the thalamus over dinner and a steady supply of tiramisu and sarma.
- **Bald & Bold**: Shaved my head to optimize my aerodynamics for faster paper reading.

## 🤓 What Drives Me?  

The human mind is like a neural network—complex, adaptive, and occasionally prone to catastrophic forgetting. My mission is to bridge the gap between **neuroscience and technology**, turning the challenges of mental health into opportunities for innovation.  

Freud said, “Unexpressed emotions will never die.” I believe they just need better quantification tools, like fMRI machines, neural nets, and a bit of Python.

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s unravel the mysteries of the mind together—one dataset, one eigenvector, and one cup of coffee at a time. 🚀
